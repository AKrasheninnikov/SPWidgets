SPWidgets
=========

Sharepoint Custom UI Widgets that make building custom User Interfaces easier.
It includes:

- An Upload Plugin
- A User selection plugin


Upload Plugin
-------------

The upload plugin allows a user to upload a file via "ajax" without leaving 
the page that they are currently on. This plugin has only one required 
input parameter: the Document library to where the document should be uploaded. 
Other optional parameters are available to fine tune its usage. 


Pick User Plugin
----------------

Given an input field, this method will display an interface that allows the 
users to select one or more users from SharePoint and store the selected user 
information into the input field in the format expected when making an update 
via webservices. The input field will be hidden in its current position and a UI 
will be displayed instead. As the user picks or removes users, the input field 
will be updated at the same time, thus it will always be ready to be submitted 
as part of an update to the server.
